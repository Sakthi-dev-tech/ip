# UI Test Plan

## Test configuration

- Build command: `rm -rf out && javac -d out $(find src/main/java -name '*.java')`
- Default launch command: `java -cp out rambo.Rambo`
- Timeout per test case: 10 seconds
- Output includes standard output and standard error.
- Cases run in order in a fresh process and stop at the first failure.
- `ordered` matching requires each listed literal to appear after the previous one; unrelated output is allowed between literals.

## Test cases

### UI-08 — Handle end-of-input at the main menu

- **Aim:** Try to break the UI by closing standard input instead of entering `q`; it should terminate cleanly rather than print a stack trace.

```text
Enter your option:
Bye my friend!
